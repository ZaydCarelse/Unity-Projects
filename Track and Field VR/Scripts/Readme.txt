Project 3 of 30 (30 VR projects challenge)

This project is meant to be a clone of the experience I've had playing Sprint Vector on the PSVR. The limitations are that I cannot use a 6DoF controller like the Move Controller with a Google Cardboard SDK build.

I will build this as a prototype for now and upgrade it once I have saved up enough to be able to buy a Oculust Quest 2.
