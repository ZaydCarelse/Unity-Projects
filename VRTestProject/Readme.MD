Jailbreak Kingdom VR

This is the first of my 30 day VR prototype challenge builds.

The folder was named VRTestProject as I wasn't originally intending to build anything with it but then as luck would have it, inspiration struck and the folder name stuck. Lol.

Please forgive the untidy coding structure in some of the files. At the end of each week I will be doing a code review and restructuring of each prototype's code.

If you'd like to know anything about the project, feel free to drop me a message at zayd.carelse@gmail.com
